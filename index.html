<h1>Out of commission</h1>

<p>This boundary service is no longer supported. It would need a bit of TLC to get the Django code updated to a currently maintained version of the framework. If you'd like to help with this effort, please reach out to us in the <a href="https://github.com/HackJersey/nj-boundaryservice/issues">Github issues</a> for this project.</p>
